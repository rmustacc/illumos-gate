 * Device driver for the Designware I2C controller. Currently this only works on

 *
 * ---------
 * Discovery
 * ---------
 *
 * The designware I2C block is a common I2C controller that is found on a wide
 * number of platforms. The means by which it is discovered varies on the
 * platform. While it is most often an MMIO device that is discovered by some
 * platform-specific means (e.g. ACPI, device tree, etc.) it can also sometimes
 * be found as a PCI(e) device. The driver is intended to work with any parent
 * that can set up a reg[] entry.
 *
 * ------------------
 * I/O State Machines
 * ------------------
 *
 * The hardware functions by having a variable sized FIFO that may be smaller
 * than the overall size of the request. Commands are pushed into this FIFO
 * which result in either a read or write of a byte on the bus occurring. After
 * a request is started, we basically have the following rough state machine:
 *
 *  Framework Request
 *       |
 *       * . Fixed request start up: programming address
 *       |   registers and resetting interrupt related bits.
 *       |
 *       v
 *     +----+
 *     | TX |---------------------------+------------------+
 *     +----+                           |                  |
 *       |                              |                  |
 *       * . Once all bytes are         |                  |
 *       |   transmitted.               |                  |
 *       v                              |                  |
 *     +----+                           |                  |
 *     | RX |---------------------------+------------------+
 *     +----+                           |                  |
 *       |                              |                  |
 *       * . Once all bytes are         |                  |
 *       |   received.                  |                  |
 *       v                              |                  |
 *     +------+                         |                  |
 *     | STOP |-------------------------|------------------+
 *     +------+                         |                  |
 *       |                              |                  |
 *       * . Once the controller        |                  |
 *       |   indicates it has written   |                  |
 *       |   a stop.                    |                  |
 *       v                              |                  v
 *     +------+                         |              +-------+
 *     | DONE |<------------------------+--------------| ABORT |
 *     +------+                                        +-------+
 *       |
 *       |
 *       v
 * Framework Reply
 *
 * The broader I2C framework guarantees that only one request can be outstanding
 * at a time due to the fact that the bus can only have one I/O ongoing at any
 * time. We first start the transaction by claiming the bus, setting up the
 * address information, and beginning to fill bytes in the command buffer. First
 * we fill any bytes to transmit. If there are no bytes to transmit or we fill
 * all the transmit commands and still have space, then we'll move onto filling
 * the command buffer with receive commands. Once those are done (or if there
 * are none), we'll finish by writing a stop command into the command FIFO. Only
 * once the command FIFO is finished, then we will proceed to the DONE state and
 * reply with a successful command to the framework.
 *
 * Of course, it wouldn't be I2C if everything just worked. There are two
 * different classes of errors that can occur. The first is when the controller
 * tells us that there was a transmit abort. We get this as part of polling for
 * status. This includes everything from an address NAK to arbitration lost, or
 * that we got a NAK while reading from the target. In those cases, the
 * controller will have stopped everything and the queues end up flushed. When
 * this kind of abort occurs, we translate the hardware specific cause
 * information into the appropriate I2C error. The behavior that we do is
 * captured in dwi2c_aborts[]. In general, we don't log most errors other than
 * things that we think are related to weird behavior as a result of the driver
 * and panic on error that could only happen due to gross programmer error at
 * our end (e.g. we receive an error related to target mode that we don't
 * enable).
 *
 * The second class of error is our internal state machines ABORT, aka
 * DW_I2C_IO_ABORT. This occurs when we have no response from the hardware after
 * any period of time. The most common case for this is when we're on a bus
 * without the proper pull up resistors to function. When this occurs, we'll
 * instead turn off the device and issue a hardware abort. The controller will
 * reply relatively promptly to the abort.
 *
 * Now, inside of the original state machine is a second state machine related
 * to the FIFO depth. The FIFO has both a transmit and receive maximum depth.
 * These tell us how many commands we can issue before we need to take action.
 * Notably when we issue any command (whether for a read or a write) that goes
 * into the transmit FIFO. Any data that comes back goes into the read FIFO.
 * Related to this, there are thresholds around where the hardware will notify
 * us about the FIFO's state. There are separate RX and TX thresholds.
 *
 * We always set the RX threshold to trigger the moment there's a single byte.
 * There's no reason to do anything else as the moment data is available we want
 * to read it, even if there's more data available. The second bit is the TX
 * threshold. We basically set that to half the size of the TX FIFO. The idea
 * here is that since we'll fill up the TX FIFO with commands, there's no need
 * to come back to that until there's enough space to issue another chunk of
 * commands.
 *
 * Let's expand the TX state that we had above for a moment:
 *
 *     +-----------+                    +----------+
 *     | Data to   |---*--------------->| TX Queue |
 *     | transmit? |   . Yes            | Full?    |
 *     +-----------+                    +----------+
 *       |    ^                           |      |
 *  No . *    |                      No . *      * . Yes
 *       |    |           +--------+      |      |
 *       |    +-----------| Insert |------+      |
 *       |    |           +--------+             |
 *       |    |                                  v
 *       |    |                        +--------------+
 *       |    +------------------------| TX Threshold |
 *       |                             |   Crossed    |
 *       v                             |  Status Set  |
 *  Proceed to RX                      +--------------+
 *
 * To determine if the TX FIFO is full, we look at the depth of the FIFO and
 * compare that to the limit that we set. Because of the nature of how the
 * interrupts work, even if the FIFO transitions while we're processing it,
 * because of the write-to-clear nature, we will find that fact when we next
 * look for status.
 *
 * One important thing here is that this doesn't actually indicate whether the
 * data was successfully sent. That's ultimately why we end up waiting for the
 * stopped status, which is our sign that everything is done on the transaction.
 * Next, let's discuss how we deal with RX commands.
 *
 * RX commands come in two parts, we have to put data into the transmit FIFO and
 * then we have to read it out of the receive FIFO. This puts an important bound
 * on the amount of receive commands that we want to issue. Instead of us just
 * asking if the TX FIFO is full, we need to ask is the TX FIFO full and how
 * much outstanding I/O is there to be read in the RX FIFO. Imagine a case where
 * the TX FIFO had 32 entries, but the RX FIFO only had 16. If we put more than
 * 16 read commands into the TX FIFO, then then the RX FIFO would lose data.
 *
 * This is also why we'll always attempt to process the RX FIFO once we're in
 * the RX state first, before we send commands. Once we enter the RX state, we
 * also change our interrupt mask, removing asking for an interrupt on an empty
 * TX FIFO as what matters isn't that the TX FIFO is empty, but that we have
 * data in the RX FIFO. This is roughly summarized in the following flow
 * diagram:
 *
 *    +----------+        . No   +----------+        +----------------+
 *    | All data |--------*----->| Drain RX |------->| All read bytes |<----+
 *    |   read?  |               |   FIFO   |        |   requested?   |     |
 *    +----------+               +----------+        +----------------+     |
 *       |    ^                                         |          |        |
 *       |    |           . Yes                         |     No . *        |
 *       |    +-----------*-----------------------------+          |        |
 *       |    |                                                    |        |
 *       |    |                                                    |        |
 *       |    |                                                    v        |
 *       |    |           . No                          +-------------+     |
 *       |    +-----------*-----------------------------|  Space in   |     |
 *       |                                              | TX/RX FIFO? |     |
 *       |                                              +-------------+     |
 *       |                                                      |           |
 *       v                                                      v           |
 * Proceed to STOP                                         +--------+       |
 *                                                         | Insert |->-----+
 *                                                         +--------+
 *
 * After this point, we simply insert a stop command to be inserted into the
 * transmit FIFO, which always has space for this by definition of our state
 * machine (if we've read everything there are no commands) and we can proceed
 * to wait for the controller to acknowledge it.

 *    we are responsible for indicating the stop bit manually. Because this is
 *    unknowable, we must always do it. This only applies here if there is
 *    nothing to read after we are done writing.
 *  - We will write as much data as we can into the transmit FIFO. If there is
 *    more data to write than fits in one go, then we'll wait until we are given
 *    another interrupt.
 *  - Once we have written everything, we are responsible for indicating the
 *    next state transition that we are waiting for.
 *  - When inserting read requests we need to both consider the tx and rx queue
 *    depths. See the receive I/O State Machine in theory statement for more
